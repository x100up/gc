This is set of git hooks, that can be used to check files for coding standards
and to run unit tests on commited or pushed files.

Here are provided two hooks and install script to make it easy to use them.
Hooks are:
    pre-receive: This is a hook, that is invoked in git in case someone tries
                 to push content to repository from the remote machine.
                 Obviously :), it should be installed on the central repository
                 server.

                 When run, it checks pushed files for coding standards and runs
                 all unit tests on the new version of the project.
                 In case any of previous actions fail, push will be rejected.

                 NOTE: Coding standards are checked on modified files on all
                 commits together, if there were some bad code between first and
                 last commit, it will be ignorred.

                 To install this script you need to go SomeProjectName.git/hooks
                 directory on the server with central repository and run
                 two following commands:

                 $ git show HEAD:tools/GitHooks/install.php > install.php
                 $ php install.php pre-receive

                 Running install script again will update contents, if something
                 have changed in git repo (including install script).

    pre-commit:  This is a hook, that is invoked in git in case someone tries to
                 commit staged files. So, again obviously ;), it should be
                 installed on developers machine.

                 When run, it checks staged files for coding standards. If there
                 are errors, commit is aborted.

                 To install this script you need to go .git/hooks in
                 directory in the root of you copy of repository and run
                 two following commands:

                 $ git show HEAD:tools/GitHooks/install.php > install.php
                 $ php install.php pre-commit

                 Running install script again will update contents, if something
                 have changed in git repo (including install script).


REQUIRMENTS:

For correct work of coding standard check following is needed:
    * PHP_CodeSniffer from github (version after Feb 19, 2012)
        to install it you need to run following commands:

        $ git clone https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.git
        $ sudo pear install PHP_CodeSniffer/package.xml

        And if you don't have pear installed, you can find out how to install
        it in google :)

For correct work of unit-tests following is needed:
    * PHPUnit 3.6 or later
    * runkit php extension from github
        to install it you need to run the following commands:
